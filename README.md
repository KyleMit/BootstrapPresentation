## Introduction to Bootstrap Demo

This demo is like a slide deck for developers.  Each commit represents a set of changes toward creating a starter page with Bootstrap.  You can fork this entire repository and walkthrough each of the code changes by jumping around to each commit, using <code>git checkout <a href='http://git-scm.com/docs/gitrevisions'><i>&lt;revision&gt;</i></a></code>

## Stepping Through Commits

I wrote an article about [using using revision control to demo live coding changes](http://www.codingeverything.com/2014/06/StepThroughCodeDemo.html)

Here's the short version:

```
git config --local alias.child-sha "!git rev-list HEAD..master | tail -n 1"
git config --local alias.initial-commit "!git rev-list --all | tail -n 1"

git checkout master
git checkout $(git initial-commit)
git checkout $(git child-sha)
```
